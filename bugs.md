## 🔥 BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED - PRIORITY ORDER

### 🟠 CRITICAL PRIORITY - FIX IMMEDIATELY
#### Spring Security Exclusion Issue
**ID:** SEC-001  
**Status:** 🔴 Open - **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**  
**Priority:** 🟠 Critical  
**Component:** Backend Security  
**Date Identified:** 2025-09-03  
**Assigned To:** [Unassigned]  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 1-2 hours  

**🚨 WHY THIS MUST BE FIXED NOW:**
- **Security Vulnerability**: All API endpoints are completely unprotected
- **Production Risk**: Cannot deploy to production in current state
- **Data Exposure**: Actuator endpoints leak sensitive system information

**Problem Summary:**
Spring Security auto-configuration exclusion is not working despite being configured in `application.properties`. Application shows security warnings and all endpoints remain unprotected.

**Quick Fix Options (Choose One):**
1. **Immediate**: Remove `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency from `pom.xml`
2. **Proper**: Implement proper security configuration
3. **Temporary**: Fix exclusion syntax and rebuild

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- ❌ Production deployment blocked
- ❌ All endpoints publicly accessible
- ❌ Sensitive data exposure
- ❌ No authentication/authorization

**Files to Modify:**
- `pom.xml` (remove security dependency)
- `src/main/resources/application.properties` (remove exclusion)
- Add `SecurityConfig.java` if implementing proper security

## 🔧 BUG RESOLUTION WORKFLOW

When fixing bugs, follow this process:

1. **Update Status to "In Progress"** (🟡)
2. **Assign the bug** to yourself
3. **Document the fix approach** in the bug description
4. **Implement the fix**
5. **Test the fix thoroughly**
6. **Update status to "Resolved"** (🟢)
7. **Move to "Recently Fixed"** section (⚫)
8. **Update the dashboard**

**Example Resolution Entry:**
```
✅ FIXED: SEC-001 - Spring Security Issue
- Date: 2025-09-03
- Fix: Removed spring-boot-starter-security dependency
- Verified: All endpoints now start without security warnings
- Testing: Manual verification of endpoint access
```

## 🛡️ PREVENTION MEASURES
1. **Security First**: Always review security configurations before deployment
2. **Environment Separation**: Use different configurations for dev/staging/production
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review actuator endpoints and API security
4. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and check for security vulnerabilities
5. **Logging Review**: Monitor application logs for security warnings and errors
